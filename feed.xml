<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/44/yoga.jpg" alt="Yoga" width="4000" height="6000" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/yoga-xs.jpg 300w ,https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/yoga-sm.jpg 480w ,https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/yoga-md.jpg 749w ,https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/44/responsive/yoga-xl.jpg 1200w"></figure>
<h3 class="align-center">Yoga &amp; Recovery</h3>
<p>Do you use drugs or alcohol to self-medicate? Yoga supports the treatment &amp; recovery of trauma and addiction by restoring the disconnection that occurs due to substance abuse and traumatic events. Perhaps you use to avoid feeling difficult emotions or just to help you cope with a stressful lifestyle? Overtime you avoid processing emotions and so when you stop self-medicating it can feel very overwhelming and fill you with anxiety, dread and paranoia. Yoga reduces anxiety and research has shown that yoga has been an effective way of reducing and in some cases eliminating symptoms of PTSD and anxiety.</p>
<h3 class="align-center">“Fire &amp; Ice” Therapy</h3>
<p>Wim Hof has advocated the benefits of cold-water therapy for addiction recovery and rehab centres worldwide took notice and so did we!</p>

You will be guided through your sessions by Sara, the only combined Wim Hoff and thermalist therapy qualified practitioner globally. Merging cold water, the warmth of the sauna and deep breath work, your body will efficiently burn off cortisol (the stress chemical your body produces) reducing stress and anxiety, leaving your mind clearer, your body revitalised and emotionally stronger and empowered.</p>

<h3 class="align-center">Sara - Devon Sauna Hub</h3>
<h4 class="align-center">Thermalist &amp; Breathwork Therapy “Fire &amp; Ice”</h4>
<p>Sara, is currently the only woman in the UK jointly qualified as a Thermalist Instructor &amp; a level 2 Wim Hoff Method Instructor.  Combining these specialist areas is unique &amp; considered to be the highest form of qualifications currently available for Thermalist &amp; Breathwork combined therapy, globally!</p>
<p>Thermalist Therapy is essentially Hot &amp; Cold Therapy – moving your body between hot elements (sauna) &amp; cold elements (cold water) reconnecting body &amp; mind &amp; keeping them in their optimum state. The healthy stress of the cold &amp; the heat navigated by the breath, builds your cells stronger, increases your metabolism &amp; strengthens your nervous system. Our body’s natural ‘fight -or- flight’ response, releases high levels of cortisol (the stress chemical) into the bloodstream &amp; when this is left unmanaged results in our bodies &amp; brains becoming unbalanced. Combining the shock of the cold-water therapy with the release of calming chemicals in our body from the breathwork &amp; sauna, Sara can restore your mind &amp; body’s natural balance, leaving you feeling relaxed, revigorated &amp; recentred.</p>

                <p class="align-center">The specialist training provided by Lantern is delivered using a psychologically informed approach. This reflects the knowledge that we are all impacted by our environment and experience, and this is closely related to how we can care for our own wellbeing.</p>
<p class="align-center">Lantern's specialist training covers a range of topics that offer a deeper insight into sometimes difficult and challenging material. While offering education on these topics, we are also mindful of the potential affect it might have for people attending the courses. Extra care is taken by our psychotherapist trainers to offer one to one support and signposting for anyone who has been affected by issues raised.</p>
<p class="align-center">Our specialist training sessions are five to six hours in duration and can be delivered online, on-site or in another location as part of an event. There will always be time available at the end of the session for informal discussion and personal support.</p>
