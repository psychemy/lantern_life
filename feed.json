The healthy stress of the cold &amp; the heat navigated by the breath, builds your cells stronger, increases your metabolism &amp; strengthens your nervous system. Our body’s natural ‘fight -or- flight’ response, releases high levels of cortisol (the stress chemical) into the bloodstream &amp; when this is left unmanaged results in our bodies &amp; brains becoming unbalanced. Combining the shock of the cold-water therapy with the release of calming chemicals in our body from the breathwork &amp; sauna, Sara can restore your mind &amp; body’s natural balance, leaving you feeling relaxed, revigorated &amp; recentred.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/43/accomodation.jpg\" alt=\"Accomodation\" width=\"1150\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/43/responsive/accomodation-xs.jpg 300w ,https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/43/responsive/accomodation-sm.jpg 480w ,https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/43/responsive/accomodation-md.jpg 749w ,https://lanternlife.co.uk/media/posts/43/responsive/accomodation-xl.jpg 1200w\"></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 800; font-family: sans-serif; text-align: center;\">If you have any questions about this retreat please call us on <a href=\"href=\" tel:=\"\" 44=\"\" 1903=\"\" 953766=\"\">01903 953766</a><br>or <a href=\"https://lanternlife.co.uk/contact-us/\">contact us</a> and a member of the team will be happy to help.</p>\n<div class=\"relationship\">\n<p style=\"padding: 2em 2em 0 2em; margin-top: 4em; font-size: 1.25em; font-style: italic; text-align: center; color: #bf598c;\">\"Join us for this empowering retreat and take the first step towards your healing and empowerment journey\"</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; padding-bottom: 2em; margin-top: 1.25em;\"><a href=\"https://lanternlife.co.uk/contact-us/\" class=\"btn\"><strong>Registration complete.</strong><br>Please subscribe to our mailing list/newsletter to receive details of our 2025 Retreats.</a></p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"align-center\">\"Spaces are still available on our <a href=\"https://lanternlife.co.uk/christmas-recovery-resilience-retreat/\">Recovery Resilience Retreat</a>\"</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; padding: 2em 1em 2em 1em;\">*Accommodation, all meals, psychotherapy groups and all retreat activities (unless otherwise stated) included.<br>**We are happy to accept instalments and payment plans.

While offering education on these topics, we are also mindful of the potential affect it might have for people attending the courses. Extra care is taken by our psychotherapist trainers to offer one to one support and signposting for anyone who has been affected by issues raised.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">Our specialist training sessions are five to six hours in duration and can be delivered online, on-site or in another location as part of an event.
